# FreeBSD14
my little research on FreeBSD.

Hello everyone, my name is Michel and I have been trying for some time to do a complete installation of FreeBSD 14 in French, because I live in French-speaking Switzerland.
Here are three shell script files which, after installing Freebsd from a USB key, allow you to configure different options.

use instructions on installgithub.txt to copy them.
copy them all and you will have a FreeBSD tuning configuration.
I also install some programs and all that on KDE.

copy all files in /media/ directory and start the first shell script.

at the end of execution, reboot, login and start the next script.
same for the third.

I spent a lot of time on this installation with my little knowledge, so I hope you will be indulgent.
