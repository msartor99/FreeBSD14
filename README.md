# FreeBSD14
my little research on FreeBSD.

Hello everyone, my name is Michel and I have been trying for some time to do a complete installation of FreeBSD 14 in French, because I live in French-speaking Switzerland.
Here are one text TO-DO shell instructions files which, after installing Freebsd from a USB key, allow you to configure different options.

copy them all and you will have a FreeBSD tuning configuration.
I also install some programs and all that on KDE.

I spent a lot of time on this installation with my little knowledge, so I hope you will be indulgent.

august 2025, them new version 2.0 is here. simplified.
