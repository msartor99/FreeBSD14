# FreeBSD14
my little research on FreeBSD
Hello everyone, my name is Michel and I have been trying for some time to do a complete installation of FreeBSD 14 in French, because I live in French-speaking Switzerland.
Here are three files which, after installing Freebsd from a USB key, allow you to configure different options.
I also install some programs and all that on KDE. I spent a lot of time on this installation with my little knowledge, so I hope you will be indulgent.
